## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leogaudin/minitalk.git
```

2. Compile the source code using the provided Makefile:
```bash
make
```

> This will generate two executables: `client` and `server`.

3. Launch the server by executing the `server` binary:
```bash
./server
```

> The server will display its process ID (PID) on the console.

4. In a separate terminal window, launch the client by executing the client binary with the server's PID and the message you want to transmit:

```bash
./client <server_pid> <message>
```

> Replace `<server_pid>` with the PID displayed by the server, and `<message>` with the text you want to send.

Example:
```bash
./client 12345 Hello
```

> This will send the message "Hello" to the server with the PID 12345.

5. The server will receive the message and display it on the console:

```bash
Hello
```

> The server will display each character as it receives them.

6. You can repeat steps 4 and 5 to send multiple messages to the server.

## How Does Minitalk Work?

The communication between the client and server is achieved using signals.

The client converts each character of the message into 8 bits (1 byte) and sends them to the server one by one.

### Client
1. The client reads the server's PID and the message from the command-line arguments.
2. It iterates over each character in the message.
3. For each character, it calls the `send_signal` function, which sends 8 signals to the server.
4. The `send_signal` function converts the character into 8 bits and sends each bit as a signal to the server. It uses `SIGUSR1` to represent a 1 bit and `SIGUSR2` to represent a 0 bit.
5. After sending each bit, the client waits for a short duration (42 microseconds) using the `usleep` function. This delay allows the server to process the received signals.

### Server
1. The server starts by displaying its PID on the console.
2. It sets up signal handlers for `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals using the `sigaction` function.
3. The server enters an infinite loop and waits for signals using the `pause` function.
4. When a signal is received, the corresponding signal handler (`handle_signal`) is called.
5. The `handle_signal` function extracts the bit value (0 or 1) from the received signal and appends it to the current character being received.
6. If the character is fully received (8 bits), it is displayed on the console using `ft_printf`. The bit index and current character are reset to prepare for the next character.
7. After processing the received signal, the server sends a signal back to the client. If the received signal was SIGUSR1, it sends SIGUSR1 to acknowledge the received bit. If the received signal was SIGUSR2, it sends SIGUSR2.

### Bonus Features

The provided source code includes a bonus version (`client_bonus.c` and `server_bonus.c`) that adds additional functionality:

* Unicode characters like ü¶Å are already supported in the mandatory part.
* Sending back a read receipt can be achieved by using the `sigaction` structure, that allows to access metadata about signal transmission.
   * The client displays a message on the console for each bit it sends. It prints "Received bit 1" for `SIGUSR1` and "Received bit 0" for `SIGUSR2`. This can help visualize the communication process.
   * The server sends an acknowledgment signal back to the client after receiving each bit. If the received signal was `SIGUSR1`, it sends `SIGUSR1` to the client. If the received signal was `SIGUSR2`, it sends `SIGUSR2`. This allows the client to know that the server has successfully received the bit.
These additional features enhance the interactivity and feedback during the communication process.
